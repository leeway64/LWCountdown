== CMake Basics ==

=== Introduction ===
CMake is a [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-cmake-tutorial.html#new-project meta build system]
that [https://medium.com/@onur.dundar1/cmake-tutorial-585dd180109b manages the build process] in
an operating system-independent and compiler-independent way.

[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-cmake-tutorial.html#new-project CMakeLists.txt files]
can generate build files for a specific environment/OS.
[https://medium.com/@onur.dundar1/cmake-tutorial-585dd180109b For example], CMake creates Makefiles
on Unix-based machines and creates projects on Windows machines. This is why CMake is referred to
as a meta build system.

Let's refer to the CMake commands shown in the [[../README.md|README]]:

<code> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja -G Ninja -S . -B ./cmake-build-release</code>

<code>cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target LWCountdown</code>


=== Configuration ===
<code> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja -G Ninja -S . -B ./cmake-build-release</code>

The configuration step generates the native build system (e.g.: make).


=== Build ===
<code>cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target LWCountdown</code>

The build step calls the build system to compile or link the project.
