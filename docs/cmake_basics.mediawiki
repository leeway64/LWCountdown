== CMake Basics ==

=== Introduction ===

CMake is a meta build system (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-cmake-tutorial.html#new-project)
that manages the build process in an operating system-independent and compiler-independent way
(https://medium.com/@onur.dundar1/cmake-tutorial-585dd180109b).

CMakeLists.txt files can generate build files for a specific environment/OS (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-cmake-tutorial.html#new-project).
For example, CMake creates Makefiles on Unix-based machines and creates projects on Windows machines (https://medium.com/@onur.dundar1/cmake-tutorial-585dd180109b).
This is why CMake is referred to as a meta build system.

Let's refer to the CMake commands shown in the [../README.md README]:

{{code|inline=y|lang=bash|
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja -G Ninja -S . -B ./cmake-build-release
cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target LWCountdown
}}


=== Configuration ===
{{code|inline=y|lang=bash|
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja -G Ninja -S . -B ./cmake-build-release
}}

The configuration step generates the native build system (e.g.: make).


=== Build ===
{{code|inline=y|lang=bash|
cmake --build ./cmake-build-release --target LWCountdown
}}

The build step calls the build system to compile or link the project.
